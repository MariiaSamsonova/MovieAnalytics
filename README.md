# MovieAnalytics
Big Data project

The project collected and processed data about movies.
Movie data visualization includes regional translations on the world map, the average rating
of a movie depending on the year of release, the highest-rated genres on average, the
volume each genre takes up amongst all movies, which genre and type is each cinema, and
the ratio of votes depending on the genre of the movie.
Twitter data includes #Movie and #Cinema tweets with the highest sum of engagement
metrics and the ratio of the languages that #Movie and #Cinema tweets are written on.
We decided that considering the topic of the project and our resources, this is the data that
should be visualized, as not only is it interesting, but when analyzing it one may make
decisions based on the information such as considering which genre fits which type of movie
better or what are most people interested in while watching movies.

The project was made in collaboration with Oleksandr Chuchko
